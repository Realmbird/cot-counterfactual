Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points.",

[asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA.",

So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines?

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc.

So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points.

[asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3).",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3).",

[asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3).",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines?",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3.",

But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments.

Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units.",

Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts.

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc.

[asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each.",

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units.",

Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units.",

Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again.",

Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3.

But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc.

So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle.",

Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units.

So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again.

Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees.",

Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees.",

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3.

Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code.",

Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3.",

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B).

Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments.

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check.",

Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides.

Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts.

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape?",

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units.",

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees.

Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments?",

But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units.

So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides.",

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides.

So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each).

But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought.

Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges.

Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units.

So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check.

On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought.

Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape.

Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments.",

Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3).

So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each).

But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units.

So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws:",

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1).",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3).",

Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3.

Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0).",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides.

Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments:",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side.",

Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3).

Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path.

Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side.",

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0.

Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up?

Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought.

Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units.",

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides.

So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides.

The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0.

So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles.

Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units.

Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides.",

Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3).

But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts.

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it.

Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have:",

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides.",

Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts.

Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points.

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments.

Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure.

But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0.",

[asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path.

Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure.

But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units.",

The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle, linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((0,3),1,0,-90),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,0),1,90,180),linewidth(.8));\ndraw(Arc((3,3),1,180,270),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,0)--(2,0),linewidth(.8));draw((3,1)--(3,2),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,3)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));draw((0,1)--(0,2),linewidth(.8));\n[/asy] Solution: \n<think>\n Okay, so I have this problem about a square with an area of 81 square units. Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both.",

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units).",

So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure.

Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart.",

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought.

Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides.

Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0.

Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length).",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides.

Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs. Wait, if the figure is like a square with rounded corners, where each corner is a quarter-circle with radius 3, then the straight sides would be 9 - 2*3 = 3 units each.",

Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3).

Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts.

So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs. Wait, if the figure is like a square with rounded corners, where each corner is a quarter-circle with radius 3, then the straight sides would be 9 - 2*3 = 3 units each. So, four straight sides of 3 units each and four quarter-circles with radius 3.",

Problem: Two points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure.

But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units.

Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs. Wait, if the figure is like a square with rounded corners, where each corner is a quarter-circle with radius 3, then the straight sides would be 9 - 2*3 = 3 units each. So, four straight sides of 3 units each and four quarter-circles with radius 3. So, total perimeter would be 4*3 + 4*( (2\u03c0*3)/4 ) = 12 + 6\u03c0, same as before.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs. Wait, if the figure is like a square with rounded corners, where each corner is a quarter-circle with radius 3, then the straight sides would be 9 - 2*3 = 3 units each. So, four straight sides of 3 units each and four quarter-circles with radius 3. So, total perimeter would be 4*3 + 4*( (2\u03c0*3)/4 ) = 12 + 6\u03c0, same as before. Therefore, 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs. Wait, if the figure is like a square with rounded corners, where each corner is a quarter-circle with radius 3, then the straight sides would be 9 - 2*3 = 3 units each. So, four straight sides of 3 units each and four quarter-circles with radius 3. So, total perimeter would be 4*3 + 4*( (2\u03c0*3)/4 ) = 12 + 6\u03c0, same as before. Therefore, 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. So, that seems consistent.",

Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units.

From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a continuous path made by connecting these points with arcs, but not including the straight segments. But according to the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think both contribute to the boundary. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0. Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs. Wait, if the figure is like a square with rounded corners, where each corner is a quarter-circle with radius 3, then the straight sides would be 9 - 2*3 = 3 units each. So, four straight sides of 3 units each and four quarter-circles with radius 3. So, total perimeter would be 4*3 + 4*( (2\u03c0*3)/4 ) = 12 + 6\u03c0, same as before. Therefore, 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct.",

Hmm, let me start by figuring out the side length of the square. Since the area is 81, the side length must be the square root of 81, right? So, that means each side is 9 units long. Now, the problem says that two points are drawn on each side of the square, dividing the side into three congruent parts. Okay, so if each side is 9 units, dividing it into three equal parts means each part is 3 units. So, each side will have two points: one 3 units from one corner and another 3 units from the next corner. Let me visualize the square. Let's label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 9 units. On side AB, the two points will be at 3 units from A and 6 units from A (which is 3 units from B). Similarly, on side BC, the points will be 3 units from B and 6 units from B (3 units from C), and so on for each side. Next, the problem mentions that quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown. I don't have the image, but based on the Asymptote code, it seems like each arc is a quarter-circle connecting these points. So, for example, on side AB, there are points at (0,0) to (3,0) and (6,0) to (9,0). Similarly, on side BC, points are at (9,0) to (9,3) and (9,6) to (9,9). The same applies to sides CD and DA. The figure connects these points with quarter-circle arcs. So, starting from the point on AB, 3 units from A, it connects to the point on BC, 3 units from B, with a quarter-circle arc. Similarly, from BC, 6 units from B, connects to CD, 3 units from C, and so on. So, the bolded figure is made up of these four quarter-circle arcs and maybe some straight lines? Wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw arcs and some segments. Let me parse it. The Asymptote code draws arcs from (0,0) with radius 1, but scaled up? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's a 3x3 square, but our square is 9x9. So, each side is divided into 3 parts, each 3 units. So, the radius of each arc is 3 units, right? Because the distance from the corner to the first point is 3 units. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. Therefore, each arc has a length of (1/4) * 2\u03c0r = (1/4)*2\u03c0*3 = (3/2)\u03c0 units. But how many arcs are there? From the Asymptote code, it seems like there are four arcs, each on a different side. Wait, no, each side has two points, and the arcs connect them across sides. Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws four arcs: one from (0,0), another from (0,3), another from (3,0), and another from (3,3). Each arc seems to connect points on adjacent sides. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units. So, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = (3\u03c0)/2 units. Since there are four such arcs, the total length contributed by the arcs is 4*(3\u03c0/2) = 6\u03c0 units. But wait, let me confirm. Each corner has an arc: starting from (0,0), the arc goes from (3,0) to (0,3). Is that a quarter-circle? Yes, because the radius is 3 units, and it's spanning 90 degrees. Similarly, from (0,3), the arc goes from (0,6) to (3,3). Hmm, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe each arc is connecting points on adjacent sides. So, for example, the arc from (0,0) connects (3,0) to (0,3). Then the arc from (0,3) connects (0,6) to (3,3). The arc from (3,0) connects (6,0) to (3,3), and the arc from (3,3) connects (3,6) to (6,3). So, each arc is indeed a quarter-circle with radius 3. Therefore, each arc has length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. There are four such arcs, so total arc length is 6\u03c0. But then, in the Asymptote code, they also draw some straight lines: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), etc. So, in addition to the arcs, there are straight segments. Wait, so the figure is made up of both arcs and straight lines? Hmm, let me think. Looking at the Asymptote code: - It draws arcs from (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), and (3,3), each with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius should be 3 because each side is divided into three parts. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is just a scaled version. In the code, it's a 3x3 square, but in our problem, it's 9x9. So, scaling up by a factor of 3. So, in the Asymptote code, the arcs are radius 1, which would correspond to radius 3 in our problem. So, each arc is length (2\u03c0*1)/4 = \u03c0/2, so in our case, \u03c0/2 *3 = 3\u03c0/2 per arc. But in the Asymptote code, it also draws lines like (1,0)--(2,0), which are straight segments between the division points on the same side. So, in the figure, the boundary consists of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, let me try to figure out how many straight segments there are. From the Asymptote code, it seems like on each side, between the two division points, there is a straight segment. So, on each side, there is a straight segment of length 3 units (since each side is 9, divided into three parts of 3 each). So, for four sides, that's four straight segments, each 3 units, so total straight length is 12 units. But wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it's drawing (1,0)--(2,0) on the bottom side, which is a straight segment of length 1 unit? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the square is from (0,0) to (3,0), so each side is length 3, divided into 3 parts of 1 each. Therefore, the straight segments are 1 unit each. But in our problem, the side is 9 units, divided into three parts of 3 each. So, the straight segments are 3 units each. So, on each side, between the two points, there's a straight segment of 3 units. So, four sides, four straight segments, each 3 units: total straight length is 12 units. Then, the arcs: each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3 units, as we established. Each arc is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 units. There are four arcs, so 6\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. But wait, the Asymptote code seems to draw more than that. Let me check again. Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1 from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's a quarter-circle. - Arc from (0,3) radius 1 from 0 to -90 degrees: which is another quarter-circle. - Arc from (3,0) radius 1 from 90 to 180 degrees. - Arc from (3,3) radius 1 from 180 to 270 degrees. So, each corner has an arc, each with radius 1 in the Asymptote code. But in our case, each corner would have an arc with radius 3. Additionally, they draw the straight segments: (1,0)--(2,0), (3,1)--(3,2), (1,3)--(2,3), (0,1)--(0,2). So, four straight segments, each 1 unit in the Asymptote code. So, in our case, each straight segment is 3 units, so four segments: 12 units. Therefore, total boundary is 12 + 6\u03c0 units. Wait, but 6\u03c0 is approximately 18.849 units, so total boundary is approximately 12 + 18.849 = 30.849 units. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8 or 30.9. But let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted something. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn with four arcs and four straight segments, making a sort of 4-petaled shape? Or maybe it's a square with rounded edges. But in the problem statement, it says \"quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.\" So, perhaps the boundary is made up of four quarter-circles and four straight segments, as I thought. So, each arc is a quarter-circle with radius 3, so length is (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0 per arc, four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. Total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 6*3.1416 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Wait, but the problem says \"the boundary of the bolded figure.\" So, is the bolded figure just the arcs and the straight segments? Or is it only the arcs? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws both the arcs and the straight segments. So, in the figure, the boundary is both the arcs and the straight segments. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8496, which is approximately 30.8 when rounded to the nearest tenth. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Wait, if I think about the figure, it's similar to a square with its corners replaced by quarter-circles. So, like a square with rounded corners, but in this case, the arcs are connecting division points on the sides. But in this case, the arcs are not replacing the corners, but rather connecting points on adjacent sides, which might create a different shape. Wait, maybe the figure is a square with four smaller squares attached? Or maybe it's a more complex shape. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a four-leaf clover or something similar. Wait, actually, if you connect points 3 units from each corner on adjacent sides with quarter-circles, you end up with a shape that has four curved sides and four straight sides. Wait, no, each side of the square has two points, and each point is connected to the corresponding point on the adjacent side via a quarter-circle. So, for example, on side AB, 3 units from A is point P, and 6 units from A is point Q. Similarly, on side BC, 3 units from B is point R, and 6 units from B is point S. Then, point P is connected to point R via a quarter-circle arc, and point Q is connected to point S via another arc. Similarly, on the other sides. Wait, so that would mean that the figure is made up of four quarter-circle arcs and four straight segments. Wait, but each corner of the square has two arcs connected to it. So, for instance, near corner A, there are two arcs: one connecting P to R and another connecting Q to S. But perhaps the figure is a continuous path made up of these arcs and straight segments. Wait, maybe I should try to figure out the exact path. Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws: - Arc from (0,0) radius 1, from 0 to 90 degrees: so that's the arc from (1,0) to (0,1). - Then, arc from (0,3) radius 1, from 0 to -90 degrees: which is from (0,2) to (1,3). - Arc from (3,0) radius 1, from 90 to 180 degrees: which is from (3,1) to (2,0). - Arc from (3,3) radius 1, from 180 to 270 degrees: which is from (3,2) to (2,3). Additionally, it draws straight segments: - (1,0) to (2,0): which is on the bottom side. - (3,1) to (3,2): on the right side. - (1,3) to (2,3): on the top side. - (0,1) to (0,2): on the left side. So, in total, the figure is made up of four arcs and four straight segments. So, in our problem, each arc has radius 3, so each arc is a quarter-circle with length (2\u03c0*3)/4 = 1.5\u03c0. Four arcs: 6\u03c0. Each straight segment is 3 units, four segments: 12 units. So, total boundary length: 6\u03c0 + 12 \u2248 18.8496 + 12 \u2248 30.8496 \u2248 30.8 units. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to interpret the figure.

Calculating that numerically: 6\u03c0 \u2248 18.849559, so 18.849559 + 12 = 30.849559. Rounded to the nearest tenth: 30.8. Wait, but let me check if it's 30.8 or 30.9. Looking at 30.849559, the tenths place is 8, the hundredths place is 4, which is less than 5, so we round down. So, 30.8. Therefore, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units. But let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the figure. Wait, another way to think about it: the figure is a square with side length 9, but with each side having two points, and arcs connecting these points on adjacent sides. So, each side contributes two segments: a straight segment in the middle and an arc at each end. But wait, in this case, each corner has an arc, and between the arcs, there is a straight segment. Wait, so for each side, we have: - From the first division point to the corner: an arc. - Then a straight segment between the two division points. - Then another arc from the corner to the next division point on the next side. Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps each side has a straight segment in the middle and two arcs at the ends. But since each side is divided into three parts, the middle segment is 3 units, and the two arcs at each end connect to the adjacent sides. But in that case, each side would have a straight segment of 3 units and two quarter-circle arcs each of radius 3. But that would mean each side's contribution is 3 + 2*(1.5\u03c0) = 3 + 3\u03c0. But with four sides, that would be 4*3 + 4*3\u03c0 = 12 + 12\u03c0, which is way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps my initial interpretation is better: the boundary consists of four straight segments and four arcs, each arc on a corner, connecting the division points on adjacent sides. So, the four straight segments are each 3 units, and the four arcs are each 1.5\u03c0 units. Therefore, the total boundary length is 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a single continuous path that goes along the arcs and skips the straight segments. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawing both the arcs and the straight segments, so I think the boundary includes both. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square with rounded edges, but in this case, the rounding is done by connecting the division points on adjacent sides. Wait, if that's the case, then each corner is replaced by a quarter-circle arc, and the sides between the arcs are straight lines. So, the perimeter would be the sum of the four straight sides (each 3 units) and the four quarter-circle arcs (each 1.5\u03c0 units). So, same as before: 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. Alternatively, if the figure is a single continuous curve, maybe it's a circle or something else, but given the description, it's connecting points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs. Wait, another approach: each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, so each part is 3 units. Then, on each side, the two division points are 3 units apart. Connecting these points on adjacent sides with quarter-circle arcs would create a shape that's similar to a square with rounded corners, but with a radius equal to 3 units. But in that case, the perimeter would be 4*(side length + arc length). But the side length here is not the original 9 units, but the straight segments between the arcs. Wait, if the figure is like a square with rounded corners, where each corner is a quarter-circle with radius 3, then the straight sides would be 9 - 2*3 = 3 units each. So, four straight sides of 3 units each and four quarter-circles with radius 3. So, total perimeter would be 4*3 + 4*( (2\u03c0*3)/4 ) = 12 + 6\u03c0, same as before. Therefore, 12 + 6\u03c0 \u2248 30.8. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct. Thus, the length of the boundary is approximately 30.8 units.",
